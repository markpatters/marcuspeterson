            <h2>Smart Thermostat</h2>
            <img src="therostat.jpg" alt="project image 1" width="300" height="200">
            <p>Team Project for ETECH-100 Class. First experience working with hardware and software. Worked on software for the device. Software included menu system to reset the clock and temperature which displayed results on a LCD screen. Software was written in Arduino code which is very similar to C/C++.</p>
            <h2>Convolution Neural Network</h2>
            <img src="ccn.png" alt="project image 2" width="100%">
            <p>Individual Project for CEE-235 (signals and systems). Trained a neural network using the principle of convolution, to develop a binary classification system between two datasets. System was created using the TensorFlow library in Python.</p>
            <h2>Bluetooth Snake game</h2>
            <img src="snake_game.jpg" alt="project image 3" width="400" height="300">
            <p>Pair project for CEE-325 (Digital System Design). Project involved using a FPGA board to receive Bluetooth communications to control a VGA monitor. First experience with hardware descriptive language or VHDL.</p>
